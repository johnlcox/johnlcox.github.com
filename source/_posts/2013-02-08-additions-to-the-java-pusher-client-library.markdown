At [Stackify](http://www.stackify.com) we are using [Pusher](http://pusher.com/) for retrieving data and allowing users to execute real-time commands with the Stackify agent.  The [client library for Java](https://github.com/jmschultz/JavaPusherClient) recommended by Pusher doesn't support all of the features that we needed.  It is a good library, but needed some updating.
