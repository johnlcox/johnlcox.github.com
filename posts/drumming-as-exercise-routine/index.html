  <p>I wanted to get into a regular exercise routine, but I have a really hard time getting into a routine doing something I really don&rsquo;t enjoy.  In the past I&rsquo;ve tried to get into running on my treadmill.  Running on the treadmill is really hard for me &ndash; my mind starts to wander and I get utterly bored after only a few minutes.  Even with music or Netflix to distract me while I run, I just can&rsquo;t do it.  My attempts to get into a running routine typically last around one week.  I have decided to run an experiment of drumming as exercise routine, and see what happens.  I have a lot of respect for people with the discipline to keep up an exercise routine.</p>
<p>Before I go into more detail about the drumming as exercise routine, first a little history.  I got to thinking about how I was able to stay in shape during college.  I never made any point to exercise in college and the food I ate was by no means healthy.  Most of my time in college, I also drank Coke as my main liquid, drinking almost no water.  I probably had a higher metabolism while in college, which contributed to staying in decent shape.  I also played a lot of guitar hero and later Rock Band.  Guitar Hero certainly isn&rsquo;t going to burn as many calories as running or cycling, but standing for hours on end, on a daily basis, certainly burns more calories than sitting and watching TV or playing on the computer.  The calorie burning was kicked up a notch when <a href="http://www.rockband.com/">Rock Band</a> was released in 2007 and I moved on to playing Rock Band drums for hours on end.</p>
<p>When Harmonix released Rock Band, I already owned an electronic drum set.  With the help of the <a href="http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?t=20420&amp;page=15">Rock Band forum</a> community, we figured out a way to rig up a midi module with outputs soldered to the Rock Band drums so that we could play Rock Band with a real electronic drum set.  With the upgrade to a real drum set, I was playing hours of drums everyday for the last semester and a half of college.  I think the full drum set experience made a big difference toward staying in shape.</p>
<p>After college I continued to play drums on a fairly regular basis for a couple of years, but I eventually slowed down and completely stopped.  Shortly before Thanksgiving last year I started to think about drumming again for exercise.  I started by doing some Google searches in hopes to find some evidence that drumming is decent exercise.  I found a lot of typical forum posts with people arguing back and forth, but to my surprise I found an actual scientific study, done by the  University of Gloucestershire and the University of Chichester.  A lot of the technical details of the study are available on the <a href="http://www.clemburkedrummingproject.com/Research.html">Clem Burke Drumming Project website</a>, and the BBC also have an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7518888.stm">interesting article</a> about the study indicating that professional drummers burn between 400 and 600 calories an hour.</p>
<p>Based on the research and my desire to exercise again I decided to start up a regular drumming routine again.  Yes, I&rsquo;m playing Rock Band 3 when I&rsquo;m exercising, but I&rsquo;m doing so on a real electronic drum set, and I choose songs mostly from the Nightmare/Impossible difficulty level.  I&rsquo;m definitely not burning 400-600 calories an hour, but I&rsquo;d guess I&rsquo;m burning somewhere between 150-300 calories per session.  My goal is to play for 45 minutes or more at least 3 days a week.  It&rsquo;s been almost two months since I started and so far I have lived up to this goal.  On the weekends I sometimes find myself playing 2 hour sessions.</p>
<p>Generally I create a playlist of 10 songs and start rocking out.  By picking the songs ahead of time and creating a playlist it creates the smallest amount of downtime between songs; this way my heart rates stays elevated throughout the play session.  I&rsquo;m not any good at measuring my heart rate, but it is definitely elevated while drumming (though not nearly as much as when I run).  I hope to get a digital heart rate monitor, so that I can get a better idea of my heart rate while playing, and at least make some back of the envelope calculations on how many calories I&rsquo;m burning.</p>
<p>Around the same time I started my drumming exercise routine my girlfriend started a more traditional exercise routine.  We have turned it in to a little competition.  We are both going to continue with our separate exercise routines and in May we are going to run a 5K.  We will determine which exercise routine is better based on who finishes first.  Realistically both exercise routines are good, but it&rsquo;s always fun to add a little competition as additional motivation.</p>
