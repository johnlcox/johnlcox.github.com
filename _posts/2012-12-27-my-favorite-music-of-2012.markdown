I am by no means a music critic, but typically at the end of the year I put together a list of my favorite music from the past year, albeit normally within the privacy of my own head.  This year I decided I would make the list public.  My musical tastes seem to be pretty eclectic and all over the board.  Sometimes the albums that make it onto my list are a surprise even to myself.  This year there are 2 albums on my list that I initially did not like, but have grown a lot on me.  So without further adieu, here is my favorite music of 2012, in no particular order:

[Exitmusic - Passage](http://www.amazon.com/Passage-Exitmusic/dp/B007PLRM2G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1356578366&sr=8-2&keywords=Exitmusic+-+Passage)

[Andrew Bird - Break It Yourself](http://www.amazon.com/Break-Yourself-Andrew-Bird/dp/B006WWTJJ8/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1356578412&sr=1-1&keywords=Andrew+Bird+-+Break+It+Yourself)

[Trampled By Turtles - Stars and Satellites](http://www.amazon.com/Stars-Satellites-Trampled-Turtles/dp/B0079JMLGG/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1356664904&sr=1-1&keywords=Trampled+By+Turtles+-+Stars+and+Satellites)

[Imagine Dragons - Night Visions](http://www.amazon.com/Night-Visions-Imagine-Dragons/dp/B008K9SG9K/ref=ntt_mus_dp_dpt_1)

The Exitmusic album is by far my favorite of the year.  I only just discovered it mid-December and I have already listened to it more times than any of the other albums on my list.  Apparently I really enjoy dark, brooding, depressing albums, as evidenced by this album and my favorite album of 2009, The Antlers - Hospice.
